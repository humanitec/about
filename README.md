# We are Humanitec

Platform engineering is revolutionizing how enterprises build and run their cloud-native setups. Humanitec is at the core of this revolution, enabling teams to build [Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)](https://humanitec.com/blog/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform) and reach true developer self-service.

Humanitecâ€™s [Platform Orchestrator](https://humanitec.com/blog/what-is-a-platform-orchestrator) is the engine at the heart of a dynamic IDP. It lets platform teams, from growing startups to enterprises, remove bottlenecks by letting them build golden paths for developers. With a dynamic Internal Developer Platform, developers self-serve the tech they need to deploy and operate their apps, driving productivity and velocity.

Before Humanitec, building dynamic IDPs was hard and very expensive. It required significant budgets, talent and time. Humanitec makes this process much easier and efficient, while keeping platform teams and developers flexible along the way.
